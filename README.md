# Password-Dumpers
This repo will be updated with password dumpers for various software, all generated by A.I.

This will be eventually a penetration testing repo. Keep in mind that every single line of these files are setting antiviruses and traffic monitoring software on fire. To use them in a real-world pentest scenario, you probably need to heavily obfuscate and/or encrypt the sources.

DO NOT ask for obfuscation/encrypting methods. Except it's out of scope of this repo, I assume you have the knowledge to do it if you're a real pentester.

*Only WINDOWS related software will be added.*

## Included so far
1) Google Chrome (Tested on Windows 11)
