# Password-Dumpers
This repo will be updated with password dumpers for various software, __all generated by A.I__.

This will eventually be a penetration testing (post exploitation) repo.

Keep in mind that every single line of these files are setting antiviruses and traffic monitoring software on fire. To use them in a real-world pentest scenario, you probably need to heavily obfuscate and/or encrypt the sources.

**DO NOT ask for obfuscation/encryption methods**. It's out of the scope of this repo.

*Only WINDOWS related software will be added.*

## The road so far
This script will attempt to extract data from...
- Chrome
- Edge
- Opera
- Brave
- Vivaldi

...storing them into separate folders for each browser.
